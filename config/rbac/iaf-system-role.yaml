# Role in the iaf-system namespace giving the controller read access to operator-created
# data source credential Secrets. A namespace-scoped Role is intentional here: it grants
# the minimum required privilege (get/list on Secrets in iaf-system only), not a
# cluster-wide ClusterRole permission on all Secrets.
